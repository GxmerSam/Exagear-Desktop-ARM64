ExaGear Desktop is a virtual machine that implements a virtual x86 Linux container on ARM-based mini PCs, enabling the direct and simultaneous running of both x86 Linux and native applications.

But it's discontinued, so this is it's package with key and how to fix it's apt error and some other stuff


### Installation:-

For Installation, you can follow this [page](https://github.com/GxmerSam/Exagear-Desktop-ARM64/blob/master/Installation.md)

Also there is [vide tutorial](https://youtu.be/ll6sPtcWDtI) too.


### What's the progress:-

Im trying it to run on android without root with the help of proot, it gets installed well and wine3.0-eltechs too, but due to ownership problems, I can't check it well. Tried wine-5.12 too, somehow it got worked but it often crashes.
Except wine, currently Spotify-Client also tried.
